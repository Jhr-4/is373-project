Notes: 9/11/24
Application anything with UI sends code to Kernel which connects to hardware (cpu, memory, etc)

VM simulates hardware 

Docker does containerization â€¦ provide a fake kernel which real applications use

Vertical scaling (one cpu turned into a vm that runs with tons of speed) vs horizontal scaling (one cpu turned multiple VMs that allow for multiple nodes and allow for more responses to be handled, parrelization )

Container Orchestration software - orchestrates where the containers are running, it opens network ports, share data, 

Threading 

Docker guide should explain:
History of virtualization
What is containerization 
Differences between docker and kubernetes
What is kernel, what is threading, etc.
