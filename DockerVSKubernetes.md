Makes testing a prototyping rather easy
Easy setup, user friendly interface
Lightweight and uses fewer resources compared to VMs

## Kubernetes

Automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
More complex, but may feature more powerful orchestration features that can be used for organizations that have large scale demands
