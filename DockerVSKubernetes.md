# Docker vs Kubernetes

While both Docker and Kubernetes are tools that are frequently used in app deployments, their capabilities differ, especially in the context of containerization.

## Docker 
- Used for building, shipping, and running applications inside container
- Ease of use can make it particularly useful for small-scale projects and organizations that can benefit from rapid deployment
- Makes testing a prototyping rather easy
- Easy setup, user friendly interface
- Lightweight and uses fewer resources compared to VMs

Advantages of Docker
- Easy setup, user-friendly interface
- Rapid development and rapid deployment
- Lightweight, resource optimization 
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Kubernetes
- Container orchestration tool used to manage large-scale container developments
- Automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
- More complex, but may feature more powerful orchestration features that can be used for organizations that have large scale demands

Advantages of Kubernetes:
- Load balancing and scaling of containers
- Ability to manage distributed systems, large-scale deployments
- Automatic rollouts and rollbacks


Between the two options, Docker comes out on top as the more lightweight option for developers. Docker enables fast deployment and relatively easy management of containerized apps. Docker is especially useful for smaller teams or projects without the need for complex orchestration due to less resource drain.
