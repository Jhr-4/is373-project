# Virtualization vs. Containerization


## Virtualization
- enables user to run multiple operating systems within a single server through a hypervisor
- Each VM runs independently
- Ideal for environments where different OS or versions are required for various applications

## Containerization 
enables users to deploy multiple apps using the same operating system on a single machine or server.
rapid deployment, portability, scalability
